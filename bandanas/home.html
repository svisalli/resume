          <h1>A sophisticated yet family-friendly establishment, Bandanas prides itself in creating an unforgettable dining experience for our customers.</h1>

            <p>At Bandanas, we live the motto “Love People, Feed Them Tasty Food”.  We believe that there’s a kindness in cooking that sets something good in motion, and we want to share it with you. Everyday we make all of our own marinades, sauces and salsas from scratch with fresh vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices. We seek out the highest quality meats, fresh-caught local fish, aged natural cheeses and the season’s glorious Jersey produce. Emphasis is on a lighter, healthier approach to cooking and our menu items are prepared fresh to order. Although we have no liquor license, you may “bring your own” or try one of our non-alcoholic beers or margaritas to complement your dining. Make sure to save a little room for your sweet tooth, and indulge in one of our amazing original ice cream creations. They’re sure to bring a smile to your face and make your taste-buds dance!

            Chef/owner Debbie Visalli and her family have been traveling for over 25 years, discovering new culinary techniques and creative recipes from all over the world to influence this innovative menu. Whether you're craving traditional Mexican favorites, char-grilled specialties, or a juicy award-winning burger, Bandanas has what you're looking for so relax and enjoy!
