HOMEWORK

0/10	Handles non-integer inputs correctly.

10/20	Does prediction correctly (and reasonably accurate).

10/10	Displays value of fib and and time.

0/20	Gives the user the option to avoid a computation lasting more
	than one hour.

results inaccurate 
doesn't warn for calculations over an hour
doesn't check for non-integer inputs
